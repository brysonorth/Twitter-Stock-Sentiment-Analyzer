# Twitter-Stock-Sentiment-Analyzer
pulls tweets using tweepy and twitter api and gives a score using VADER analyzer library. VADER is a library for determining the sentiment of strings.
The score used is the VADER compound score, which is between -1 to 1 with -1 being very negative and 1 being very positive.


twitter API access tokens need to be applied for by each user. My tokens are pulled from a  
sepereate file not in the repository.
